### Copy ChatGPT Response Chrome Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension that adds a "Copy" button to the responses generated by ChatGPT. The button allows the user to copy the response to their clipboard with just one click.
**Authors notes: code, as well as the content of the readme file, is heavily generated by ChatGPT 4!**
